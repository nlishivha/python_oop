    "## 1. Defining a Simple Class\n",
    "In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Here, we define a class `Car_` with a single method `sound()` that makes a car beep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why: \n",
    "We use classes to group related data and actions, like a car's attributes and what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What:\n",
    "This is how we create a class with a simple method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When:\n",
    "This class can be used whenever we want to represent a car and give it actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How: Syntax\n",
    "To define a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. Define methods within the class.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    def method_name(self):\n",
    "        # method body\n"

    "## 2. Adding Attributes Dynamically\n",
    "Instead of defining all attributes in the class, you can add them to an object after the object is created.\n",

    "### Why:\n",
    "This allows flexibility in adding details to an object without modifying the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What:\n",

    "\n",
    "### When:\n",
    "Use this approach when attributes are not required at object creation but can be added later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How: Syntax\n",

    "## 3. Class with an Initializer (Constructor)\n",
    "This section shows how to define a class with an initializer (constructor) that automatically sets attributes when the object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why:\n",
    "Initializers ensure that the object has the required attributes from the moment it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What:\n",
    "The `__init__` method initializes the object with predefined attributes.\n",

    "## 4. Encapsulation in Python\n",
    "Encapsulation is the practice of hiding certain attributes or methods to protect the data.\n",

    "### Why:\n",
    "We use encapsulation to protect sensitive data like personal identification numbers or car VINs, preventing direct access from outside the class.\n",

    "Private attributes in Python are indicated with a double underscore `__`. They can only be accessed through class methods.\n",

    "## 5 Polymorphism in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP) allows different classes to implement methods with the same **name** differently, providing different behaviors while sharing a common interface. This promotes flexibility and reusability in your code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why: \n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows you to define methods in different classes that share the same name but behave differently depending on the object that calls them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What:\n",
    " Using polymorphism, you can call the same method on objects of different classes, and each object will execute its own version of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When: \n",
    "Use polymorphism when you need to handle objects of different classes in a uniform way but still want them to behave according to their specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How: \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: \n",

    "## 6 Inheritence in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reusability and a logical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use inheritance to create new classes based on existing ones. This allows us to reuse code and reduce redundancy. For example, a Car class could inherit from a more generic Vehicle class, avoiding the need to rewrite common functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, inheritance is achieved by passing the parent class as a parameter when defining a child class. The super() function allows us to call methods and access attributes from the parent class within the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use inheritance when you have classes that share common properties or behavior. This allows you to define those commonalities in a base class and extend them in more specialized classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "To inherit from a parent class, pass the parent class name inside the parentheses of the child class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):\n",

    "        super().__init__(\"value1\", \"value2\")  # Call parent class constructor\n",
