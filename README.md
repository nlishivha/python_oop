# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that provides explanations, examples, and simplified syntax for key OOP concepts, making it accessible for readers of all technical backgrounds.

## Contents
- **notebook/OOP_Guide.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that covers the following topics:
  - **Defining a Simple Class**: Learn how to create a basic class and understand its structure.
  - **Dynamically Adding Attributes**: Discover how to add attributes to an instance of a class after it has been created.
  - **Using Initializers**: Explore how to initialize attributes using constructors for better organization.
  - **Understanding Encapsulation**: Understand the concept of data protection in OOP and how to implement it in Python.

## Purpose
The purpose of this guide is to introduce OOP principles in a simplified manner, enabling readers to grasp the core concepts of classes and objects. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this notebook provides a step-by-step approach to understanding OOP.

## Key Concepts Explained
1. **Classes and Objects**: Understand what classes are and how they are used to create objects, which are instances of classes.
  
2. **Attributes and Methods**: Learn about instance attributes (properties) and methods (functions) that belong to a class.

3. **Dynamic Attribute Addition**: Discover how you can add attributes to an object even after it has been created, providing flexibility.

4. **Constructors and Initializers**: Explore how constructors allow you to set initial values for your attributes when creating an object.

5. **Encapsulation**: Understand how to protect your data using encapsulation techniques, ensuring that certain attributes remain private.

## How to Use This Notebook
- **Reading Through**: The notebook is designed to be read through sequentially. Each section builds upon the previous one, so it's best to follow the order presented.
- **Examples**: You will find example code snippets followed by explanations that clarify the concepts being demonstrated.
- **Interactive Learning**: While the focus is on reading, you can also experiment with the code snippets by running them in a local Jupyter Notebook to see the outcomes firsthand.
